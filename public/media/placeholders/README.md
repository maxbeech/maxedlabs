# Missing Image Placeholders

The application is looking for the following image files that are missing:

1. `/media/dashboard-preview.jpg` - Preview of dashboard UI
2. `/media/athenic-platform.jpg` - Image of the Athenic AI platform
3. `/media/case-study-1.jpg` - Case study image for TechFusion
4. `/media/case-study-2.jpg` - Case study image for GreenLeaf 
5. `/media/case-study-3.jpg` - Case study image for FitConnect

## How to Fix

You have two options to fix these missing image errors:

### Option 1: Create the Missing Images

Create actual image files for each of the missing images and place them in the `/public/media` directory.

### Option 2: Modify the Code

The current site implementation uses CSS-based placeholders instead of actual images. You can find these placeholders in `src/app/page.tsx`. 

If you're seeing errors about missing images, it's likely that there's code elsewhere referencing these image paths that don't exist yet. Either:

1. Create the missing images, or
2. Find the references to these images in the code and update them to use the existing CSS-based placeholders

## For Development

For now, you can create empty placeholder files to prevent the 404 errors:

```bash
# From the project root
cd public/media
touch dashboard-preview.jpg athenic-platform.jpg case-study-1.jpg case-study-2.jpg case-study-3.jpg
```
