# Media Assets for MaxedLabs

This directory contains image assets used by the MaxedLabs website.

## Required Images

For production use, you'll need to add the following brand images:

- `/media/favicon.png` - Website favicon (a simple "M" icon would work)
- `/media/og-image.jpg` - Open Graph image for social sharing (1200x630)

## Current Placeholder Images

The site requires the following images which currently have empty placeholder files:

- `/media/dashboard-preview.jpg` - Preview of the dashboard UI
- `/media/athenic-platform.jpg` - Image of the Athenic AI platform
- `/media/case-study-1.jpg` - Case study image for TechFusion
- `/media/case-study-2.jpg` - Case study image for GreenLeaf
- `/media/case-study-3.jpg` - Case study image for FitConnect

**Important:** For production use, replace these empty placeholders with actual image files.

## Optional Images

The website currently uses CSS-based placeholders and icon components instead of actual UI screenshots. When you're ready to replace these with real images, you can add:

- High-quality photos of actual projects for the case studies section
- Screenshots of the Athenic AI platform in action
- Custom service icons if you prefer images over the current icon components

## Note on Development

The current implementation doesn't require any specific UI images as all visual elements are created using CSS, gradients, and SVG icons. This makes the site fully functional even with empty placeholder files in this directory.

When deploying to production, you can choose to replace the CSS placeholders with high-quality assets for a more personalized look.
